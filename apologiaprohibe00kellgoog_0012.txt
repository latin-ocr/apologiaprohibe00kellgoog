 

PREFACE. v

Ireland previous ιο the English invasion. It was deemed unnoces-
sary to correct in detail the points in which he differs srom his suc·
cessors, aa a reference to Dr. Laniger would generally he sufficient
for the purpose. On ene important question regerding the Bull os
Alexander ΠΙ. ιο Henry Π., ιο was lod uatray by the Franksert
edition ol Giraldus Cambransis, which suppressos that Bull, and
oonsounds it with Adrian’s.

The render may perhaps regret that our author has wasted so
much learning and argument on the personal character ol Giraldus.
But Giraldus, whose works had been lately published, was in those
days enlisted as apotent auxiliary fer the solution ef the old Eug-

lish difficulty, commonly called the “ settlement” of Ireland. It
had been his lot to be the apologias of the spoliation ol the lrish
by the first Aegle-Nomen invaders, and he was now, four hundred
years alter his death, employed in the same work, to complete tho
min ef the temnant of the old Irish‚ as well as of many of the
Anglo-Irish. His well-stocked armory of calumny was as useful for
the spoliation ef the Irish by law under the Stuarts, aa for their
spoliation by tho swerd under the Plantagenetc. The circumstances
os the day imparted to hia character, however contemptible, an

importunae which no writer undertaking ιο resuta him could pru- ¹

dently overlook.

Should this volume receive due encouragement, there would bo
no difficulty in publishing several works written on Catholic affair
aster thc Reformation, together with· many valuable MSS. never
printed, and rarely, if at all cited by historiens. The usual catalogue
price of Rothe's or O'Sullivan'r writings is greater than would bc
required for a copious collection of Irish Catholic authors, uniform
with the present volume.

Το S. H. Bindon, Esq. is due the discovery of the manuscript
from which the Apologia is printed. In his “ catalogue ol Manu·
scripta relating to Ireland now found in the Burgundian Library,
Brussells,” may be seen some interesting notiecs os Stephon Whito
and his writings. Tho catalogue was read before the Royal lrish
Academy‚ May ruth, 1847, and printed in their procecdings.
