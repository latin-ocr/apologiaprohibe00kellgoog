The Apologia is now published for tho first time srorn n monu-
script preserved in the Bibliotheque des Duos de Bourgogne, Brus·
selle* No other copy of the work being known to the editor, there
was no choice but ιο publish it us it stende, except in n few passages
which hed menifestly been corrupted by the copyist. On some
points, which cannot esoupe the attention of the critical render, it
would heve been desireble ιο have the benefic of c colletion of
different copies; but in general it will be found, thet however such
collatione might exercise the industry of en editor, they ure by no
means necessary to neuin the mein arguments of the author. In
the MS. from which the text is printed, e considerable quantity
of additional mutter hed been incorporated, se long parentheses, in
the body of the work. But though these parentheses ere evidently
from the sume pen us the text, it wus considered better ιο print
them es notes under the placo which thoy occupied, in order ιο nvoid
thc inconvenience of tempering with the original by editoriul eddi-
tions or ulterutions.

Whether the Apologia be worthy of the high neme of the nuthor
the learned reader must decide. But it ought not to be forgotteu,
thot it wos composed very early in the seventeenth century, pro·
bubly before the ycur 1615. Ιι could nothe expected thet u person
